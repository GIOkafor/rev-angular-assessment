# AngularAssessment

The objective of this assignment is to create an artist explorer portal.

For simplicity’s sake the artists to be ‘discovered’ are stored as json objects in a typescript file and services for retrieving profile information and music are preconfigured in the artist.service file.

Your task is to make use of this service and data to build a user interface as shown in the images below.

### Objectives

- It should be responsive i.e scale up or down, depending on the user’s viewport.
- It should pause and play audio tracks when a user clicks the play button (**the url to use for playback, is found in the preview_url property**).
- If an artist doesn't have music available it should show a message to users

Here’s a [video](https://youtu.be/N3Ly3rJep0I) showing the final solution in action.

Your solution doesn’t have to match exactly in style but it should at least accomplish all the key features listed above.

Bonus points for making use of the brand colors and font in the style.css file
